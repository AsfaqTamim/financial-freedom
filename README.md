Stoic Money provides you the tools to flexibly manage your budget, provide insight on your spending habits, guide you in your financial goals, and securely allow advisors to help. 

Why "Stoic" money? Money can be emotional in many ways. Remaining stoic while managing your money will lead to greater financial success. Being stoic while approaching your finances will lead to a more financially sound life. We will facilitate your financial stoicism with an easy to use budgeting system, helping you to set set realistic goals, and being honest with yourself about your spending habits. By practicing stoic financial management, you will live a more financially sound and peaceful life.


## What We Believe
Stoic Money is built upon the following principles.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Privacy Focused
Your money is a private matter. We 100% respect your privacy and would never sell your data. Our code is üíØ% Open Sourced so feel free to browse around and see how your data is being used. 

### üß¨ Flexible
Everyone has an opinion on how to budget, what techniques work best, etc. Stoic Money allows you to combine these methods in an un-opinionated fashion to help you save money and achieve your financial goals. Our opinion is money management should be self managed. We provide you with a place to learn, experiment and set goals following whatever teacher you have.

We made Stoic Money extensible and open source so if you want to provide some insight in a dashboard widget or expand a calculation, go for it! Our plugin system will allow for that.

### üéì Educational
Reality is the greatest of teachers. Whatever you financial circumstances, stoic money will help you become educated on what you are doing and how your spending habits contribute to your financial success.

### ü§ù Involvement
We encourage involvement in the development of stoic money. If you want to learn about the app, contribute to the app, have a question, or want to share your thoughts and opinions, we are here to listen. It takes a village. However, we have a 0% ass hole policy. Treat others with respect and you will be treated with respect. If you disrespect others, we will ban your account. Period.

### üîí Secure
Financial data should be private. Our application is built from the ground up with security in mind. We respect your data and have security measures in place so your data remains your data.

### üëç Stoic
You have what money you have so work with it. The numbers don't lie. Every day do your best and take one step forward to achieving your financial goals. So much of money management is psychological. Stoic Money aims to make managing your money seamless and un-emotional so you can achieve more financial success with as little friction as possible.
